I think it's very unlikely that you'll get banned for using this.

If you want to be safe just avoid using that. As always, use it as your own risk.</p> </li> <li> <p>Why is it an Userscript and not an extension? It's because not many browsers on Android/iOS support installing extensions (and not all extensions can be installed).</p> </li> <li> <p>Why doesn't the xCloud website implement this or that feature from Better xCloud? Think of this project as an unofficial beta version of xCloud.  </p> <ul> <li>Better xCloud doesn't have to worry about the compatibility much: if it doesn't work on this browser, it can just suggest you switch to another one. xCloud can't do the same.  </li> <li>On the xCloud's side, they have a lot more users and devices to support, so it's more difficult for them to implement a new feature.  </li> <li>Also, it's not easy to explain some of the features of Better xCloud to normal xCloud users.  </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Can I use this with the Xbox Android app?
